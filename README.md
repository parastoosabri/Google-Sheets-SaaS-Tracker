# NetSuite Operations Demo
# Project Plan and time line

> This demo was created to showcase my spreadsheet and operations tracking skills for remote roles. It includes realistic workflow use cases from sales, billing, and project.
> Keep in mind that this is just a small example of what I did because I couldn't include the information from the previous company, which was much broader in scope, and I just made a  example.

## Google Sheets Project â€“ SaaS Client Tracker (Demo)
This is a simple but functional client operations dashboard built using Google Sheets.  
It includes project timelines, conditional formatting, formula-based status flags, and simulated real-world data.



# NetSuite Operations Demo
This tab in my Google Sheet simulates real-world tasks I handled using NetSuite, including invoice tracking, payment monitoring, and exception handling.

# Salesforce_Sync_Log
That table simulates a typical data synchronization log between CRM (e.g., Salesforce) and financial or ERP platforms (e.g., NetSuite, SAP, or Coupa). It reflects how updates across systems are tracked to maintain data integrity and operational alignment.
