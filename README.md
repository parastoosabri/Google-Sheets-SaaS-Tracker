> This demo was created to showcase my spreadsheet and operations tracking skills for remote roles. It includes realistic workflow use cases from sales, billing, and project.
> Keep in mind that this is just a small example of what I did because I couldn't include the information from the previous company, which was much broader in scope, and I just made a  example.
